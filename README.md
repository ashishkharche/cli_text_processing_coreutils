# Command line text processing with GNU Coreutils

You might be already aware of popular coreutils commands like `head`, `tail`, `tr`, `sort`, etc. This book will teach you more than twenty of such specialized text processing tools provided by the `GNU coreutils` package.

My [Command Line Text Processing](https://github.com/learnbyexample/Command-line-text-processing) repo includes chapters on some of these coreutils commands. Those chapters have been significantly edited for this book and new chapters have been added to cover more commands.
