# Command line text processing with GNU Coreutils

<br>

## About

⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ This is a **work-in-progress** book on command line text processing with GNU Coreutils.

**GNU Coreutils 8.30** is the version used at the time of writing this book.

My [Command Line Text Processing](https://github.com/learnbyexample/Command-line-text-processing) repository includes chapters on various Coreutils commands. Those chapters have been significantly edited and expanded for this book.
